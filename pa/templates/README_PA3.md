### Q1: Briefly describe your implementation. Specifically, describe what you did to implement each of the functions.

A: 

### Q2: **Precision vs Efficiency**: How does BaB balance precision and efficiency compared to pure abstraction and symbolic execution?

A: 

### Q3: **Branching Strategy**: How does your input splitting strategy affect verification performance? 

A: 

### Q4: **Abstraction Choice**: What are the trade-offs between interval and zonotope abstraction in BaB?

A: 

### Q5: **Optimization Opportunities**: What improvements could make your BaB implementation more efficient?

A: 

### Q6: **Falsification**: Rank the following approaches from most to least suitable for detecting property violations (falsification): symbolic execution (PA1), pure abstraction (PA2), abstraction with BaB and attack (PA3). Think carefully and provide justification.

A:
