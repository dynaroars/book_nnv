A: 

### Q2: In `test2`, what did you do to make the assersion false (z3 returns `proved`)?
A: 

### Q3.1: What do you think the most difficult part of this assignment? (e.g., programming symbolic execution, using Z3, dealing with scalability,etc)
A: 

### Q3.2: What advice do you give other students (e.g., students in this class next year) about this PA?
A: 


## **Part 2 (10)**

### Scalability plots (Use at least 25 randomly generated DNNs of variouse size and dimensionalities)
*[Put your plots here]*

### Q1: What scalability trend did you observe? Use the plots to support your answer. 

A: 

### Q2: What conclusion can you make about applying symbolic execution on DNNs? Does is scale well?

A: 

### Q3: Provide your reasoning to justify the answer to the previouse question. 

A: 

### Q4: What are some factors that might impact the running time (e.g., # of layers in the DNN? )? Why? 

A:
