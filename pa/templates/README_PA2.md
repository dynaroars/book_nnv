### Precision plot (Use at least 25 randomly generated DNNs of variouse sizes)
- y-axis: Precision (e.g., the width of the output bound)
- x-axis: the size of the DNN (e.g. 2x3x2)
- No need to include SE as it is exact.
*[Put your plot here]*

### Scalability plot (Use at least 25 randomly generated DNNs of variouse sizes)
- y-axis: Running time
- x-axis: the size of the DNN (e.g. 2x3x2)
*[Put your plot here]*

### Q1: Briefly describe your implementation. Specifically, describe how are the bounds are represented, propagated, and concretized.

A: 

### Q2: Compare the precision and scalability trade-offs between interval/zonotope abstraction with Symbolic Execution. Use the plots to support your answer. 

A: 

### Q3: Compare the precision of both abstractions on DNNs of different width, depth and input dimension. Begin with 2x3x2, and gradually increase the numbers (i.e., add hidden layers, make layers wider, increase number of inputs). What did you observe? Summarize your findings and provide explaination.

A: 

### Q4: What are the strength and weakness of each abstraction methods?

A: 

### Q5: How to further improve the precision of the abstract domains?

A:
